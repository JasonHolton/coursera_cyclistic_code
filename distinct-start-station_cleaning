# The below SQL script is intended to clean data files by removing unecessary attributes, records and nulls/blank cells as 
well as performing calculations and format changes needed for analysis. Since the only thing that needs changed is the table 
name in the FROM statement in order to process all 12 raw data files, only one SQL script will be saved. The files being 
cleaned were first loaded into MS Excel and duplicate start_station_names (and associated row data) removed. The purpose of 
this is, using Tableau, to see if there are any geographical and demographic differences between member and casual riders. 
Removing duplicate start stations will greatly simplify the number of data points on the map and therefore make analysis 
easier (start_station_name is removed in the query since only the latitude/longitude information will be needed). Comparison 
in Tableau with data that had all start_stations included (over 4 million rows of data) showed no signs of bias when 
comparing the full vs filtered data.
